# Time Series and Neural Networks Lab

This repository contains the completed lab **C09_M08.ipynb**, which covers three main parts:  

## Part 1: Time Series Basics
- Data loading, visualization, and stationarity checks.  
- Explored time series decomposition and autocorrelation plots.  

## Part 2: ARIMA Modeling
- Implemented ARIMA for financial time series forecasting.  
- Evaluated performance with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics.  
- Produced both short-term (test set) and medium-term (60 business days ahead) forecasts.  

## Part 3: Neural Networks Implementation and Optimization
- Prepared digit classification dataset (`load_digits`) with preprocessing pipelines.  
- Built and trained MLP models using:
  - **TensorFlow/Keras**
  - **PyTorch**
- Compared activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid).  
- Achieved best performance with **Tanh activation** (~98% accuracy).
